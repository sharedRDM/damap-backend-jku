# maDMPs Backend Project for Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU)

Backend maDMPs tailored for specific university implementation.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/.

## Running the Application in Dev Mode

You can run the application in dev mode, with live coding enabled, using the following command:
```shell
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```
> **_NOTE:_** Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, accessible in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Adaptation for JKU DMP Tool

This project is based on the DAMAP backend developed in cooperation between TU Wien and TU Graz, but has been set up and adapted specifically for Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU). The adaptation focuses on institutional integration, enabling JKU researchers to efficiently manage their Data Management Plans (DMPs) while leveraging the systems at their institution.

## Installation

DAMAP can be deployed using several methods. The recommended approach is running DAMAP as containers. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) file.

## Customisation

For institutional integration, customisation details are available in the [CUSTOMISING.md](CUSTOMISING.md) file.
